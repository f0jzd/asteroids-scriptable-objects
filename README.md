# asteroids-scriptable-objects Assignment Explanation

I decided to make a small explanation of things here. The scripts That were mainly used are located in the assignment folder in the __Game_ Folder. Otherwise the ones that are used are mostly similar to eachother, just copy pasted from the original that was created during the lecture, and made into a different type e.g. from the int one in the lecture I made a transform, an Asteroid, Asteroid Fragments, etc. The asteroid fragments destroying themselves are toggleable.

I have left a bunch of comments everywhere in the project to help me understand, this is not for explaining how things work, just so that I know what I am doing and that I can return to the project at a later time to check things and get a recap.
